# Project-1- Canadian Bank Stocks 
## Scope and Purpose of Project
For the purpose of this project, our group wanted to investigate and determine a predictive model for the long term behaviour of relatively stable ETFs. 

We wanted to understand how this model would react and change due to the unforseen impacts the COVID-19 pandemic had on the Canadian Banks. For this purpose, the timeframe of the model data that we will be analyzing covers 4 years: August 2016 through July 2020. While the validation data will cover: August 2019 through July 2020 - 6 months before and after the February 2020 COVID-19 crash. Due to this being unforseen and very out of the ordinary, we will be ignoring the data up until Feb 2020 then picking our analysis back up 6 months post crash. 

Once the group determine the project scope and timeframe of which the data would be derived from, we then went to work into fidning, cleaning and summarizing the data to then be analyzed to answer our hypothsised questions. 

For the purpose of simplicity during the data analysis, we created acronyms for each of the areas of which data was pulled from.

From the collection of data, the group then cleaned,  formatted the data, using Panadas,  to ensure all values utilized in future analyzation was consistent across the board. Pandas was used to clean and format all datasets. Nulls, incomplete values, unknown charecters ect were removed from the data sets and all entries were formatted identically to ensure future visulizations would produce a picture that was accurate to the data pulled. The data sets were summarized and generic data statistics were determined. The summarization can be found [here](https://github.com/NatashaPredov/Project-1-.wiki.git).

From here, the team set off to analyzing the data using the data visualization methods taught in class to answer the groups set of main questions.
